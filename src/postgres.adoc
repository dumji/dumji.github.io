= PostgreSQL Cheatsheet

== Common

=== Reset auto-increment ids in postgres

 ALTER SEQUENCE <table name>_<column name>_seq RESTART WITH <reset id>;

 ALTER SEQUENCE product_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

=== Alter password

 ALTER USER name [ [ WITH ] option [ ... ] ]
 
where option can be:
 
 CREATEDB | NOCREATEDB
 | CREATEUSER | NOCREATEUSER 
 | [ ENCRYPTED | UNENCRYPTED ] PASSWORD 'password' 
 | VALID UNTIL 'abstime'

Example:

 ALTER USER thename WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'thepassword';

=== Create user

 CREATE USER name [ [ WITH ] option [ ... ] ]

where option can be:
    
 SYSID uid 
 | CREATEDB | NOCREATEDB
 | CREATEUSER | NOCREATEUSER
 | IN GROUP groupname [, ...]
 | [ ENCRYPTED | UNENCRYPTED ] PASSWORD 'password'
 | VALID UNTIL 'abstime'

Example:

 CREATE USER miriam WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4' VALID UNTIL '2005-01-01' CREATEDB;

Create user miriam with password ... valid until ... and can create database.

== Backup

=== Export

 $ pg_dump [connection-option…] [option…] [dbname]

Example:

 $ pg_dump dangerousdb > /tmp/db.sql
 $ pg_dump -U postgres dvdrental > /tmp/dvdrental-backup.sql

`-U`, username, Connect as the given user +
`-W`, Force a password prompt. This should happen automatically if the server requires password authentication. +
`-F`, format, Selects the format of the output. format can be one of the following:

* p, Output a plain-text SQL script file (default).
* t, Output a tar archive suitable for input into pg_restore. Using this archive format allows reordering and/or exclusion of schema elements at the time the database is restored. It is also possible to limit which data is reloaded at restore time.
* c, Output a custom archive suitable for input into pg_restore. This is the most flexible format in that it allows reordering of data load as well as schema elements. This format is also compressed by default.

=== Import

 $ psql -U postgres -d fgorm < /tmp/test.sql

`-U`, username, Connect as the given user +
`-F`, format, Selects the format of the output. format can be one of the following:

* p, Output a plain-text SQL script file (default).
* t, Output a tar archive suitable for input into pg_restore. Using this archive format allows reordering and/or exclusion of schema elements at the time the database is restored. It is also possible to limit which data is reloaded at restore time.

== Docker

Download an image from docker hub:

https://hub.docker.com/

For this example we're using `postgres:15.0-alpine3.16` image.

Run example:

 docker run \
   --name mypostgres \
   -p 5432:5432 \
   -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
   -e POSTGRES_DB=ip_addresses \
   -v /data:/home/wiji/Documents/mypostgres \
   -d \
   postgres:15.0-alpine3.16

Open postgres shell:

 docker exec -it mypostgres 
 docker exec -it mypostgres psql -U postgres -W ip_addresses

== gorm

 dsn := "host=localhost user=gorm password=gorm dbname=gorm port=9920 sslmode=disable TimeZone=Asia/Shanghai"
